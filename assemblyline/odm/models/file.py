URIInfo dissects a file's URI into its fundamental components, providing granular data for advanced search and identification.

By parsing these components, Assemblyline allows for a more nuanced analysis of the source and context of a file, which is essential for forensic investigations and threat intelligence gathering.

Each of these descriptions aims to provide a clearer understanding of the purpose and utility of the respective models within Assemblyline, highlighting their roles in the broader context of malware analysis and cyber security operations.
