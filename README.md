# Assemblyline 4 - Automated malware analysis framework

AssemblyLine 4 is an open source malware analysis framework. It leverages Kubernetes and Docker to adapt to many use cases; from a small appliance for supporting manual malware analysis and security teams to large-scale enterprise security operations scanning millions of files a day and providing triage capabilities.

AssemblyLine can be easily integrated in your environment using itâ€™s powerful rest API and web interfaces. The platform comes with dozens of services to provide deep file analysis and enable integration with other security platforms such as anti-virus, malware-detonation sandboxes and threat knowledge bases. Best of all, with a little bit of Python code you can extend it yourself by creating new analysis and integration services.

### Repository information

This is Assemblyline 4 base repository. It provides Assemblyline with common libraries, cachestore, datastore, filestore, ODM and remote datatypes.

#### System requirements

Assemblyline 4 will only work on systems running python3.9 and was only tested on linux systems.

#### Installation requirements

If used outside of our normal container this library requires outside linux libraries.

- libffi6 (dev)
- libfuxxy2 (dev)
- libmagic1
- python3.9 (dev)

Here is an example on how you would get those libraries on a `Ubuntu 20.04+` system:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt install libffi6 libfuzzy2 libmagic1 build-essential libffi-dev python3.9 python3.9-dev python3-pip libfuzzy-dev
